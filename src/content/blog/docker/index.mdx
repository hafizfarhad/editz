## Basics

In most of the challenges, you'll typically see one or two main files:

1. **Dockerfile** - This file contains Instructions to build a single container

2. **docker-compose.yml** - The file contains Instructions to build multiple containers that work together

<Callout>
When to use which file? Always use `docker-compose.yml` file if given.
</Callout>

## Install

If you haven't installed docker follow these instructions.

add gpg keys of docker in you apt package-manager and update it.

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```
install docker and its necessary plugins

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
pull run container

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

For challenges with a docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
# Build the containers (the --no-cache makes sure everything is fresh)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start the containers in the background
docker compose up -d

# See all running containers
docker ps -a

# When you're done, shut everything down
docker compose down -v
```

For challenges with a Dockerfile file:

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t challenge-name .

# Run the container (maps port 8080 on your computer to port 80 in the container)
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name challenge-name-container challenge-name

# Stop the container when done
docker stop challenge-name-container

# Remove the container
docker rm challenge-name-container
```

### Debugging

I've encountered various problems and learned useful commands along the way:

Always make sure to add `sudo` before commands, otherwise you might get "permission denied" errors.

To see container logs:
```bash
docker logs challenge-name-container
```

<Callout type="info">
`challenge-name` is the Docker image (template), while `challenge-name-container` is the running instance created from that image. You can create multiple different containers from the same image, each with its own settings.
</Callout>

### Cleanup

When you want to cleanup everything - containers, networks, volumes, use the following command:

```bash
docker system prune -af --volumes
```
